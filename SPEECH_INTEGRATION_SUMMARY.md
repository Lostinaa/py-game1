### 2. OpenAI Realtime API Integration
- **WebSocket Connection**: Stable connection to OpenAI's Realtime API
- **Speech Recognition**: Real-time conversion of user speech to text
- **Speech Synthesis**: AI-generated voice responses from NPCs
- **Turn Detection**: Server-side voice activity detection for natural conversations

### 3. User Interface Enhancements
- **Push-to-Talk**: F5 key for voice recording control
- **Visual Indicators**: Recording status and audio system feedback
- **Dual Input Modes**: Voice and text input working simultaneously
- **System Status**: F6 key to check audio system health

### 4. Error Handling & Diagnostics
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Audio system validation scripts
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback to text-only mode
- **Device Detection**: Automatic audio device configuration
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks

## Technical Architecture

### Audio Pipeline
```
Microphone → sounddevice → Audio Buffer → OpenAI API → Audio Response → AudioPlayer → Speakers
```

### Key Components
- **DialogueSystem**: Main conversation handler with audio integration

## How to Use

### Starting the Game
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py
```

### Voice Interaction
1. **Approach NPC** (HR or CEO) within interaction distance
2. **Press F5** to start voice recording
3. **Speak clearly** into microphone
4. **Press F5 again** to stop and send
5. **Listen** to NPC's voice response

### Text Interaction (Fallback)
1. **Approach NPC** as above
2. **Type message** in text input
3. **Press Enter** to send

### System Diagnostics
- **F6**: Check audio system status
- **Console**: Monitor connection and error messages

## Testing & Validation

### Audio System Test
```bash
python3 test_audio.py
```
Tests microphone, speakers, and basic audio functionality.

### Speech System Demo
```bash
python3 demo_speech.py
```
Comprehensive test of speech-to-speech capabilities.

### In-Game Testing
- Voice recording and playback
- NPC voice responses
- Interruption handling
- Error recovery

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency
- **Audio Input**: ~20ms chunks for real-time processing
- **API Response**: Network-dependent, typically 100-500ms
- **Audio Output**: Minimal latency through async playback

### Quality
- **Input**: 24kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM
- **Output**: AI-generated speech matching NPC personality
- **Processing**: Real-time with minimal buffering

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Audio Device Management
- **Issue**: Complex audio device configuration across platforms
- **Solution**: Automatic device detection with fallback options

### 2. Asynchronous Processing
- **Issue**: Coordinating audio, API, and game threads
- **Solution**: Event-driven architecture with proper thread isolation

### 3. API Integration
- **Issue**: OpenAI Realtime API version compatibility
- **Solution**: Updated to latest OpenAI library (1.99.9+)

### 4. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Graceful degradation when audio fails
- **Solution**: Comprehensive error handling with text fallback

## Future Enhancements

### Voice Customization
- NPC-specific voice characteristics
- Emotional tone modulation
- Accent and language support

### Advanced Audio Features
- Echo cancellation
- Noise reduction
- Audio effects and filters

### Performance Optimization
- Audio compression
- Caching strategies
- Network optimization

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- Microphone (USB or built-in)
- Speakers or headphones
- Stable internet connection

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- Audio drivers
- OpenAI API access

### Network
- Stable internet connection
- Low latency to OpenAI servers
- Sufficient bandwidth for audio streaming

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No Audio Input**: Check microphone permissions and device selection
2. **No Audio Output**: Verify speaker volume and device selection
3. **API Errors**: Check OpenAI API key and internet connection
4. **Performance Issues**: Monitor network latency and system resources

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Test audio system
python3 test_audio.py

# Check speech integration
python3 demo_speech.py
